### About
Finished the game? Thought you collected all the gearbits? Didn't get the 'Shine Bright' achievement? Never fear! Upload your save file into this locator tool to find those missing gearbits.

### How to Use
Find and upload your save file into this tool.
* PC - C:\Users[username]\AppData\Local\HyperLightDrifter\HyperLight_RecordOfTheDrifter_*.sav
* Mac - /Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/com.HeartMachine.HyperLightDrifter/HyperLight_RecordOfTheDrifter_*.sav
* Linux - ~/.config/HyperLightDrifter/HyperLight_RecordOfTheDrifter_*.sav

This tool will analyze your save file and determine which gearbits you're missing. For each of those missing gearbits, this tool will provide a link to one of Tteraj42's videos on YouTube which will show you exactly how to obtain that specific gearbit.
